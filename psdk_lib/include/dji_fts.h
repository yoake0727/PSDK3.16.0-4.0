 * @brief Select Fts pwm trigger.
 * - Notes:Timing requirement: This API must be called while the aircraft is on the ground (not airborne). Calls made during flight will fail or be rejected.
 * - Function: This call only selects/enables the PWM trigger port on the flight controller side.
 *   It does NOT emit PWM signals nor perform the motor-stop action itself. The actual motor-stop must be triggered by sending PWM signals via external PWM hardware pins.
 * - Recommended flow:
 *   1) Call DjiFlightController_SelectFtsPwmTrigger(position) on ground to enable the port;
 *   2) Send the motor-stop PWM from an external PWM controller to that port;
 * @param position
 * - Supported models/ports:
 *   - M400: only support DJI_MOUNT_POSITION_EXTENSION_PORT_V2_NO4.
 * @return Possible failure reasons include invalid param, aircraft not on ground, hardware unsupported, or module not initialized.
